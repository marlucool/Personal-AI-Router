# Changelog

Release history for Personal AI Router, newest first. Entries match the
published releases on GitHub.

Builds from this repository are unsigned and configure no update feed, so
automatic updates are unavailable in them.

## 0.1.5 — Avoid unnecessary cluster trust notifications (#62)

- Cluster trust notifications now follow successfully saved peer endorsements. Duplicate endorsements and failed writes no longer cause unnecessary refreshes.

## 0.1.4 — Fix HTTP connection reuse in engine health probes (#37)

- Periodic engine monitoring now reuses HTTP/1 connections instead of opening a new connection for every health probe.

## 0.1.3 — Route Anthropic Messages API requests (#27)

- The Ollama and LM Studio endpoints offered by PAIR now accept requests for the Anthropic Messages API via POST to the /v1/messages endpoint and direct them to the owner of the requested model, just as happens with the other inference methods.

## 0.1.2 — fix(mdns): send responses from UDP 5353 (GitHub Issue #1) (#102)

- Discovery traffic now originates from UDP 5353, allowing standards-compliant mDNS peers and network reflectors to accept PAIR node records.

## 0.1.1

### Fixed

- Building from source for an Intel/AMD (`x64`) target failed while compiling
  the bundled log sanitizer. The packaging script passed Electron's `x64`
  architecture name straight to the Go toolchain, which expects `amd64`.
  Arm64 targets were unaffected.

This release contains no application changes. The fix is to the build tooling
only, and the published 0.1.0 installers were not affected by it, so 0.1.1 is
functionally identical to 0.1.0 for anyone installing it.

## 0.1.0

### Fixed

- **Windows on Arm installations were missing every executable.** The
  installer's compressed payload used a compression filter its extractor could
  not decode, so an install reported success with the application tree present
  but all `.exe` and `.dll` files silently skipped. Arm64 installs now
  complete correctly.
- **Windows on Arm now installs under 64-bit Program Files** instead of the
  32-bit location.
- **Silent installs no longer abort** on the installer's payload check.

### Changed

- Raised the Electron floor and updated the Go toolchain and service
  dependencies to pick up security fixes.
- Trimmed the README, and added an `AGENTS.md` so an agent working from a fork
  has an entry point.
