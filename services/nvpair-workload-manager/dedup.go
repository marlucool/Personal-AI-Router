// safe for concurrent use — the inter-node HTTP handler runs one goroutine per
// request.

// nodeId + Workload.id + state + scheduledOn, removals key on workloadId (see
// keyLifecycle / keyRemove). nodeId is part of the lifecycle key because
// Workload.id is only unique per-node (spec §11) — without it, the same id
// from two nodes would collide. The key still omits the workload's other
// mutable metadata, so a re-broadcast carrying an updated field it does not
// cover — a corrected error string, say — is treated as a duplicate and
// dropped rather than merged. That remains a known granularity trade-off

// keyLifecycle builds the dedup key for a lifecycle event. Workload.id is only

// nodeId disambiguates nodes, and engine plus the per-process runId nonce
// disambiguate the two local engines and successive proxy runs. Dropping any
// component would collapse distinct workloads (e.g. a concurrent Ollama + LM
// Studio job both id "1") and silently discard a legitimate peer event.
//
// seq then completes the key, and it has to be the producer's event sequence
// rather than any property of the workload's current shape. This index is a
// permanent set, so anything derived from shape collides as soon as a workload
// revisits a shape it already had — and a retry does that routinely: queued on
// A, placement cleared between attempts, then queued on A again. Keyed on
// (state, scheduledOn) the third event matched the first and every peer
// dropped it, leaving their brokers holding the interim unplaced record while
// the job actually ran on A, so their schedulers stopped counting it against
// the node doing the work.
//
// state and scheduledOn stay in the key as well. They cost nothing, and they
// keep the key meaningful for a producer that has not stamped a sequence.
//
// This does not weaken what the index is for: a broadcast retry resends an
// identical frame, sequence included, so a true redelivery still dedups — and
// that is what protects a consumer from an out-of-order retry reverting a
// placement. A re-sync heartbeat bypasses this index altogether (see
// isResyncFrame).
